Gym Bro is a new tool for personal trainers to talk, organize, follow, and set tasks and exercises for their clients in a professional UI design environment designed to boost trainers' productivity and their client's experience, allowing both to evolve in a new, over human, speed.

In this project, I am creating the whole website where people will interact and discover the benefits and the many uses and opportunities the tool offers. It will also integrate functional login and signup methods for access to the web app desktop.

In another project, by the end, I will finish developing an app for the clients to interact with their trainers and recommendations.

So don't miss out, and enjoy!<br>
